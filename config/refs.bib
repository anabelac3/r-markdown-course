  abstract = {Aims: To examine levels of burnout among staff working in community-based services for people with personality disorder (PD) and to explore factors which add to or lower the risk of burnout among people working in such services., Methods: In-depth interviews with staff working at 11 dedicated community-based personality disorder services in England together with a cross-sectional staff survey using the Maslach Burnout Inventory., Results: Levels of burnout were generally lower than those reported in previous studies among mental health workers and levels of personal accomplishment were higher. Staff reported positive as well as negative experiences of working with people with PD. Strong team-work, clear leadership and opportunities for reflective practice were thought to protect staff from burnout., Conclusions: The low levels of burnout we found may reflect the early stage of the development of these services. However, it is also possible that working with people with PD does not in itself lead to burnout, especially when services are organized to share and contain work-related anxiety.},

  abstract = {Job satisfaction continues to be one of the most studied job attitudes in Industrial and Organizational Psychology (Judge et~al., 2017). Academics and practitioners alike have recognized the worth of job satisfaction, given its usefulness in predicting vital organizational effectiveness outcomes (Judge \& Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012; Society for Human Resource Management, 2015). In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive review of the job satisfaction literature. First, we discuss the history of job satisfaction and how the construct has been explicated and refined over time. Second, we describe the various paradigms and approaches to the measurement of job satisfaction, along with important measurement considerations. Third, we review the antecedents (dispositional, contextual, and event-based) and outcomes (performance, effectiveness, organizational citizenship behavior [OCB], counterproductive work behavior [CWB], and withdrawal) of job satisfaction. Finally, we synthesize decades of job satisfaction research to suggest how the study of job satisfaction can move forward. As some examples, we suggest researchers employ theory elaboration (Fisher \& Aguinis, 2017) approaches to prune and elaborate on job satisfaction theory and that researchers continue to delve into clarifying the role of affect in job satisfaction. We also suggest that practitioners closely focus on the determinants of job satisfaction, especially justice perceptions, which strongly predict job satisfaction. We conclude that a continued focus on job satisfaction is critically important:~in the tumultuous modern climate wrought with high turnover rates, satisfied employees are more likely to be loyal champions, ambassadors, and advocates to their organizations.},

  abstract = {[Objective: To investigate whether psychosocial work environment and health behaviors are risk factors for sick leave due to mental disorders, and whether familial confounding (genetics and shared environment) explains the associations. Methods: Respondents (n = 11,729), given to complete a questionnaire in 2004 to 2006, were followed up approximately 5 years for sick leave spells due to mental disorders, using national registry data. Data were analyzed using logistic regression, and conditional logistic regression for twin pairs discordant for sick leave (cotwin control). Results: High job demands, job strain, and iso-strain were independent risk factors for sick leave due to mental disorders. Familial factors seem to be of importance in the associations between job support, smoking, a combination of unhealthy behaviors and sick leave. Conclusions: Improving the psychosocial work environment may be effective in preventing sick leave due to mental disorders.]}

  abstract = {Narcissism has been studied in relation to leadership and productivity in the workplace. However, few studies have been conducted on how narcissism influences work attitudes. The first goal of this study is to measure the association between narcissism and the five factor model (FFM) of personality in an organizational sample. The second goal is to measure the influence of narcissism on job satisfaction when controlling for FFM traits. A total of 224 employees from a public organization have filled out self-rating measures of job satisfaction, FFM traits and a measure of narcissism. Results indicated that narcissism was positively correlated with FFM extraversion and openness to experience and negatively correlated with agreeableness. Narcissism had a significant influence on job satisfaction, even when controlling for FFM traits. We believe that these results stress the importance of better understanding the role of narcissism in employee attitudes in order to weigh the pros and cons of hiring or promoting narcissistic employees.},
